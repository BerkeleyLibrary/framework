# Handle user sessions and omniauth (CAS) callbacks
#
# When a user attempts to access a restricted resource, we redirect them (via
# an {ErrorHandling} hook) to the #new action. This sets the return url, if
# it's known, and forwards them on to Calnet for authentication. Calnet
# returns them (via Omniauth) to the #callback method, which stores their
# info into the session.
#
# The nitty gritty of Calnet authentication is handled mostly by Omniauth.
#
# @see https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth
class SessionsController < ApplicationController
  # Redirect the user to Calnet for authentication
  def new
    redirect_args = { origin: params[:url] || home_path }.to_query
    redirect_to "/auth/calnet?#{redirect_args}"
  end

  # Generate a new user session using data returned from a valid Calnet login
  def callback
    logger.debug({
      message: "Received omniauth callback",
      omniauth: auth_params,
    }.to_json)

    @user = User.from_omniauth(auth_params)

    sign_in @user

    redirect_to params[:url] || request.env['omniauth.origin'] || home_path
  end

  # Logout the user by redirecting to CAS logout screen
  def destroy
    sign_out
    end_url = "https://auth#{'-test' unless Rails.env.production?}.berkeley.edu/cas/logout"
    redirect_to end_url
  end 

  # Handle Calnet authentication failures
  #
  # Currently, Calnet has no way of triggering this, although it's rumored to
  # be in development for a future release.
