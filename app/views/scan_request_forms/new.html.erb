<h1>Faculty Alt-Media Scanning</h1>

<p>The Library provides alt-media scanning services for Berkeley faculty and instructors who
qualify under the Chafee Amendment to the Copyright Act and who choose to enroll in the
service.  This amendment states:</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
  <p class="ml-3 text-secondary small">It is not an infringement of copyright for an authorized entity to reproduce or to distribute copies or phonorecords of a previously published, nondramatic literary work if such copies or phonorecords are reproduced or distributed in specialized formats exclusively for use by blind or other persons with disabilities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This alt-media scanning service is intended to support Berkeley faculty and instructors in their teaching and research.</p>

<p>The Library provides qualified users with digital files of the library's print collection.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scans will be handled in the order they are received, with one item scanned for each user waiting
  before second items will be handled for anyone.</li>
  <li>The person requesting the item will receive email notification when the digital file is ready.</li>
  <li>The email will include a link to download the digital file.</li>
  <li>The Library will do a light correction of the OCR.</li>
  <li>The file will be available as a Word document and as a searchable PDF.</li>
</ul>

<p>By completing this form, the individual is indicating that they have a disability which qualifies them for this service. The Library is not a medical provider, and accepts the individual's word that they qualify for this service.  Upon receipt of this form, the Library adds a generic note to the person's borrower record ("library book scan eligible"). The Library does not share this information in any other way with other entities on campus or off campus.</p>

<p>Use this form both to opt-in to the service, and to terminate the service if your circumstances change. Please allow up to 48 hours for your status in the system to be updated.</p>
