  <h1>Request for Access to Main (Gardner) Stacks</h1>
  <p>The Main (Gardner) Stacks are open to everyone with a current University of California ID (from any UC campus), UC Berkeley Library Card or proxy borrower card, LBNL ID, or Stanford ID. Prepare to show your ID for entry.</p>
  <p>Members of the public who have research needs can obtain a Main (Gardner) Stacks access pass at no charge. Stacks passes are granted for browsing and using the library collections, not for general activities such as studying or meeting friends. A current government-issued photo ID is required to request a stack pass; people under the age of 18 utilizing the collection must be accompanied by a parent/guardian. Prepare to show your approved stack pass for entry.</p>
  <p>Requests for same-day access, or for access up to 7 days in advance, can be made in-person during <%= link_to 'Library Privilege desk hours', 'https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/visit/doe' %> or by completing and submitting the form below. Regarding the online form:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>For <b>same-day</b> access, Monday through Friday, your request must be submitted by 10 AM. To visit the Stacks on the weekend, the request must be made by 2 PM on the previous Friday.</li>
    <li>If your request is approved, you will receive your pass as an email attachment. <strong>You may print out the pass before coming to the Library or you may save the pass to your phone.</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Requests for longer-term access can be made in person at the <%= link_to 'Privileges Desk', 'https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/find/privileges-desk' %> or via the <%= link_to 'Main Stacks Reference Card Request form', new_reference_card_form_path %>.</p>
