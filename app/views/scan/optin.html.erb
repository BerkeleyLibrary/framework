You have successfully opted in to the alt-media scanning service.<br/><br/> 

How to use the service:<br/>
Take the item(s) to be scanned to any library circulation desk. Present your faculty ID<br/>
and state that the item is for scanning. If there is more than one item to be scanned, please<br/>
prioritize the order in which items should be scanned. If you need the item after it is scanned,<br/>
ask the circulation desk staff person to place a hold on the item for you.
