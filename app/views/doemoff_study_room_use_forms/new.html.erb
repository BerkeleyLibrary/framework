  <h2>Borrowing Guidelines</h2>

<p></p>

  <ul>
    <li>The current academic year Doe/Moffitt Study Room/Studio Use Agreement Form must be signed electronically or in person prior to borrowing a study room key for any and all Moffitt Library and Gardner Main Stacks study rooms.</li>
    <li>Study room use (key check-out) is limited to only current UC Berkeley students, faculty, staff, and post-docs/visiting scholars.</li>
    <li>Advance reservations must be made online at <a href="http://berkeley.libcal.com">berkeley.libcal.com</a>; each individual user is permitted up to two hours per day (a day is defined as from 12:00:01 a.m. - 11:59 p.m.) booked in advance.</li>
    <li>If availability permits, individuals and groups may inquire at the Doe circulation desk or Moffitt 4th floor service desk to inquire about availability of walk-up reservations, granted only for the current hour.</li>
    <li>Users must vacate the room at or before the reservation end time; all belongings must be removed and doors must be locked after vacating the study room; rooms should be left neat and free of trash, and users/groups must return rooms to the correct occupancy (number of chairs) before returning the key.</li>
    <li>There is absolutely NO food/drink permitted in the Gardner Main Stacks and its study rooms.</li>
  </ul>

<p></p>

  <h2>Fines and Liability</h2>

<p></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Reservations end at :50 of the last hour of the reservation; the key/pager must be returned to the correct circulation/service desk by the end of the hour to avoid penalties. Tardiness in vacating rooms, returning keys, and other poor room use etiquette (judged at library staff discretion) may result in a temporary block from study room use in both Moffitt Library and Gardner Main Stacks rooms.</li>
    <li>Misuse of keys/study spaces including, but not limited to, keeping a key beyond the start of the hour immediately following a reservation’s end, keeping a key after attempts by library staff to page keys and/or contact users, vandalism/damage to library property/study spaces, and removing keys/pagers from library premises, may result in a temporary loss of room use privileges and/or an assessment of a key/pager replacement charge of $310.00 (300.00 refundable upon key/pager return, 10.00 non-refundable billing fee).</li>
    <li>If the pager OR key (one or the other alone) is broken/lost/stolen the replacement charge is $160.00.</li>
    <li>If the key and pager are both broken/lost/stolen the replacement charge is $310.00</li>
    <li>Misconduct regarding the reservation and/or usage of Doe/Moffitt study rooms may result in an immediate and temporary or permanent ban from Doe/Moffitt study room use and potential referral to the Center for Student Conduct.</li>
  </ul>
