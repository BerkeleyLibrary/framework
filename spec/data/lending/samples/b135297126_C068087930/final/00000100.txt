 

INTO THE WHIRLWIND, 1927-31

From 1927 to 1929 the European economy appeared to perform to a
respectable standard. There was still cause for concern regarding
aspects of agriculture and heavy industry output, and most countries
remained a long way off the spectacular rates of growth achieved by
the United States. But the general atmosphere was one of optimism
about the future, reinforced by political stability in much of Europe
and new-found international harmony in the wake of the Locarno
treaties. As events during the next three years were to demonstrate,
confidence in all these aspects — political, diplomatic and economic —
was gravely misplaced. The first signs there was a storm brewing came
as early as 1927 in Germany. As one of the best studied and most
important economies in Europe, the ‘late’ Weimar economy provides
the opportunity to explore the complex nature of economic recovery
in central Europe in the 1920s. The history of the Weimar’s low
performance economy and its interaction with other countries also
underlined how far, and in what ways, the fate of national, regional
and international economies was linked.

Critics of Europe’s performance in the second half of the 1920s were
particularly worried about reparations, and spiralling levels of
international indebtedness more generally. They argued ‘the only thing
it [American lending] really taught us, is that it is extremely easy to
pay old obligations with new debts.’' In 1929, the issue took on a strong
contemporary significance because the Wall Street Crash coincided
with international negotiations for the Young Plan, a new scheme
designed to keep the reparations settlement afloat. Histories of the
Great Depression traditionally date the onset of the crisis to the collapse
